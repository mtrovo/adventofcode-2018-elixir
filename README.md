# Advent of Code 2018

My attempt at [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018), solving the daily tasks while taking the time to learn some Elixir.

The overall structure of this project was adapted from [scmx/advent-of-code-2018-elixir](https://github.com/scmx/advent-of-code-2018-elixir).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `adventofcode_2018` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:adventofcode_2018, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/adventofcode_2018](https://hexdocs.pm/adventofcode_2018).
